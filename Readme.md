## OpenCV Benchmarks

Just unit testing is not enough for many OpenCV algorithms. Quality assessment
with synthetic data and large scale dataset required.The repository is designed
to develop quality assessment tests, utilities and debugging tools for complex
OpenCV algorithms. The repository does not cover ML and DNN models accuracy.
Please, consider [Model Zoo Benchmark](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/blob/master/benchmark/README.md)
for DNN models.
